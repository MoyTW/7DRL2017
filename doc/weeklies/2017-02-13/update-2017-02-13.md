# Last Week

## Objectives

### COMPLETE: Create an AI System

+ Add in more clauses for conditions
+ Return GameEvents from Actions
+ Integrate Conditions/Actions into the Arena system

### IN PROGRESS: Genetic Algorithm for AI

+ Genetic algorithm runs
+ Genetic algorithm optimizes
+ Genetic algorithm hooked into Tournament structure

## Summary

Set up an AI system, composed of conditions and actions. Set up a
genetic algorithm in the tests to run it. However, there's
basically no room to optimize it - once you get down to "Shoot at
the enemy if you see it and it's in range" the current options
top out.

For example, there's no "Move away from the enemy" option.

# This Week

## Objectives

### Genetic algorithm for AI

+ Add enough diverse statements to make optimization possible
+ Hook optimization into the Tournament system

### Benchmarking

+ It may not actually be possible to run this every game time
+ If the algorithm runs too slowly, consider optimization
