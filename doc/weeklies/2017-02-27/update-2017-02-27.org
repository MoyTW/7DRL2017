# Last Week

## Objectives

### PARTIALLY COMPLETED: Pilots

+ Add pilots
+ Add unique bonuses to pilots
+ Save pilots and assign pilots to mechs

### COMPLETED: Genetic algorim uses AI *and* Hanger builds

+ Combine the two
+ Evolve the two in tandem

This may be pretty weird because I don't know if I want to somehow have *two*
chromosomes, or if I want to have *one* chromosome with some weird intermixing
of the two modes, or how to actually implement this well!

### ADDED: Optimization

+ Make the genetic algorithm take less time to run

### NOT STARTED BONUS: Equipment Diversity

+ Add grenades
+ Add smoke grenades
+ Weapon swapping rules & usefulness assessment
+ Tweak a bunch of equipment to encourage different strategies

## Summary

Dropped the pilots off in favor of hooking up the genetic algorithm to use both
the AI and Hanger sections. Did that, and then hooked it into the main menu and
started putting the shiny new profiler to use! Unfortunately it's a trial
license so NProfiler will be gone in like, a week. Sad!

The main impediment to actually evolving things I think is that it's *extremely*
slow, and it doesn't converge very fast due to the very high amount of
options. I need to find a way to speed it up, or the whole concept just won't
work; there's no way to have interesting AI if it takes a week to bake, and if
it takes that long to bake I won't be able to iterate on it.

# This Week

## Objectives

### Optimization

+ Genetic algorithm should run faster

This may involve some sacrifices on the niceness of the ECS design.
