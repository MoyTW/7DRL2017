# Last Week

## Objectives

### IN PROGRESS: Genetic algorithm for AI

+ DONE: Add enough diverse statements to make optimization possible
+ Hook optimization into the Tournament system

### NOT STARTED: Benchmarking

+ It may not actually be possible to run this every game time
+ If the algorithm runs too slowly, consider optimization

### ADDED: Pilots

+ Add pilots
+ Add unique bonuses to pilots
+ Save pilots and assign pilots to mechs

## Summary

Did not decide ultimately to hook the AI genetic algorithm in, because I felt
that in order for it to actually be interesting it would have to actually
optimize equipment AND there needed to be more diversity in equipment and
tactics.

This is because there's essentially a degenerate, VERY BORING strategy right now
- you find the optimal range for you, and then you just sit there and shoot at
the enemy. Incredibly dull!

Also there was a SNAFU with my two machines - I had a branch with AI-related
stuff on my home desktop, but I forgot to push it to the repo so I didn't have
it on my laptop. Whoops. As a result, I started on pilots as an attempt to
increase variation between AIs.

# This Week

## Objectives

### Pilots

+ Add pilots
+ Add unique bonuses to pilots
+ Save pilots and assign pilots to mechs

### Genetic algorim uses AI *and* Hanger builds

+ Combine the two
+ Evolve the two in tandem

This may be pretty weird because I don't know if I want to somehow have *two*
chromosomes, or if I want to have *one* chromosome with some weird intermixing
of the two modes, or how to actually implement this well!

### BONUS: Equipment Diversity

+ Add grenades
+ Add smoke grenades
+ Weapon swapping rules & usefulness assessment
+ Tweak a bunch of equipment to encourage different strategies
