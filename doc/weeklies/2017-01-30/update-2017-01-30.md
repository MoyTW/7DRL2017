## Summary

Our President is sure something. Not even two weeks in! I am not super happy
with the political state of the country right now and that has taken up some of
my time on this weekend. Things are a little wild.

That kind of threw off my projections, because I did not see this coming. Didn't
even work on this Saturday.

Current progress is that I've imported the json deserializer, and am starting to
build out the Blueprint system.
