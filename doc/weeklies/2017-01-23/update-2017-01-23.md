# Last Week

## Objectives

### COMPLETED: Implement holsters

### IN PROGRESS: Implement weapon switching as a valid action

Currently working on the UI for doing this.

### NOT COMPLETE: Use a json-based definition for mech parts

Didn't even get here.

### Create a AI system

Didn't even get here.

## Summary

Got sidetracked when looking at weapon switching. I wanted to add a new menu,
then I looked at my menuing code and cried. I ended up completely refactoring
it. Also changed the way in which selectors work.

Work done:

+ Implement holsters
+ Refactor menu system
+ Change the subentities query to contain info in classes themselves
+ Add dependency (requires/cannot be after) info to Components

So, I didn't actually get what I wanted to get done. I should have at least been
able to see I'd have to rework the menus when I was looking at holsters last
week!

### Implement weapon switching as a valid action

+ Add UI for weapon switching
  - List carried weapons
  - List available mounts
  - Selection of weapon & mount
+ Broadcast event to mount/unmount & swap

### Use a json-based definition for mech parts

+ Add json parsing library
+ Add "Blueprint" class for mech parts
  - Blueprint is a Entity Factory
+ Add registry of blueprints
  - Weapon mounts/holsters are cross-producted
+ Convert all existing parts to blueprints in EntityBuilder

### Use a json-based definition for mech construction

+ Add "Mech Blueprint" class for mechs
+ Add registery of mech blueprints
+ Convert all existing mechs to blueprints in EntityBuilder

### BONUS: Create an AI System

Investigate this further when (if) you get here!
