* Core
** DONE AI (Non-Learning)
*** DONE Hard-coded AI can move and fight
  - Arena fn which executes a Command (used by player)
  - Arena fn which "executes non-player"
    - Calls out to AI Component for a Command
    - Executes the Command on the Arena

** TODO Full Arena Loop
*** DONE Ability to delay until next friendly action
*** DONE Win condition to exit Arena
*** DONE AI v. AI matches
*** Ability to replay Arena /w AIs
**** DONE Replaying the combat between two AIs

We will require:

+ RNG Seed
+ Initial AI + Mech states

For now, we assume that the AI + Mech are immutable over the duration of the
game. Therefore, we only need the RNG Seed. We can construct the specified map
with the specified Pilot and Mechs, and simply replay.

**** Replaying the combat between player + AI

We will require:

+ RNG Seed
+ Command list from player (Mech 1)
+ Initial AI + Mech state (Mech 2)

Instead of blocking on player input, we will feed the player command into the
game. In order for this to be sane, we should actually *invert* the control so
that the Arena calls out to a Player (conceptually the same as the AI) for a
command, instead of the player inputs directly hitting the state of the Arena.

This will come after, however.

** Mech Construction
*** Remaining Parts

+ Head sensors: increase LOS
+ Power Plant: provide cooldown penalties if damaged
+ Arm actuators: hold weapons, fire weapons
+ Leg actuators: move speed bonus
+ Holster (small, medium, large): hold weapons
+ Weapon mount (small, medium, large): fire weapons
+ Booster: increase speed for short period of time

** Pilot Skills

+ Adds bonuses to selected stats

** TODO Tournament

+ AIs can play each other
+ You can watch AIs play each other
+ You play your matches in order

*** TODO Competitors

The concept of a "Competitor" is a Pilot + Mech, though players may customize
their mech between matches.

*** TODO Format

The tournament is a group-stages->elimination tournament. The lower rounds of
the tournament are round robin, highest scorer progresses. The higher rounds of
the tournament are a 32-player double elimination tournament.

There are 256 initial combatants, divided into 32 groups of 8. The 32 groups of
8 each play a round robin series, and the top player progresses. Each of the 32
groups plays all their matches fully before the next plays any (this is for
simplicity, no other reason). Ties are settled by a reduced round robin.

*** TODO Implementation

**** TODO Class Tournament
Tracks tournament state 

API
+ Given a list of Combatants, generate a schedule
+ Register match played + Winner
+ Query for "Next Match Given Round"
+ View all of the above
+ Ability to save and load (?)

** UI

+ Combat log
+ Less atrocious UI
