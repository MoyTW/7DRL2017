* Core
** DONE AI (Non-Learning)
*** DONE Hard-coded AI can move and fight
  - Arena fn which executes a Command (used by player)
  - Arena fn which "executes non-player"
    - Calls out to AI Component for a Command
    - Executes the Command on the Arena

** TODO Full Arena Loop
*** DONE Ability to delay until next friendly action
*** DONE Win condition to exit Arena
*** DONE AI v. AI matches
*** TODO Ability to replay Arena /w AIs
**** DONE Replaying the combat between two AIs

We will require:

+ RNG Seed
+ Initial AI + Mech states

For now, we assume that the AI + Mech are immutable over the duration of the
game. Therefore, we only need the RNG Seed. We can construct the specified map
with the specified Pilot and Mechs, and simply replay.

**** TODO Replaying the combat between player + AI

We will require:

+ RNG Seed
+ Command list from player (Mech 1)
+ Initial AI + Mech state (Mech 2)

Instead of blocking on player input, we will feed the player command into the
game. In order for this to be sane, we should actually *invert* the control so
that the Arena calls out to a Player (conceptually the same as the AI) for a
command, instead of the player inputs directly hitting the state of the Arena.

This will come after, however.
