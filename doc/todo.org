* Core
** DONE AI (Non-Learning)
*** DONE Hard-coded AI can move and fight
  - Arena fn which executes a Command (used by player)
  - Arena fn which "executes non-player"
    - Calls out to AI Component for a Command
    - Executes the Command on the Arena

** TODO Full Arena Loop
*** DONE Ability to delay until next friendly action
*** DONE Win condition to exit Arena
*** DONE AI v. AI matches
*** Ability to replay Arena /w AIs
**** DONE Replaying the combat between two AIs

We will require:

+ RNG Seed
+ Initial AI + Mech states

For now, we assume that the AI + Mech are immutable over the duration of the
game. Therefore, we only need the RNG Seed. We can construct the specified map
with the specified Pilot and Mechs, and simply replay.

**** Replaying the combat between player + AI

We will require:

+ RNG Seed
+ Command list from player (Mech 1)
+ Initial AI + Mech state (Mech 2)

Instead of blocking on player input, we will feed the player command into the
game. In order for this to be sane, we should actually *invert* the control so
that the Arena calls out to a Player (conceptually the same as the AI) for a
command, instead of the player inputs directly hitting the state of the Arena.

This will come after, however.

** Mech Construction
*** Remaining Parts

+ Head sensors: increase LOS
+ Power Plant: provide cooldown penalties if damaged
+ Arm actuators: hold weapons, fire weapons
+ Leg actuators: move speed bonus
+ Holster (small, medium, large): hold weapons
+ Weapon mount (small, medium, large): fire weapons
+ Booster: increase speed for short period of time

*** Remaining Weapons
| Item             | Size   | Accuracy | Refire | Damage | Range  |
|------------------+--------+----------+--------+--------+--------|
| Missile          | Medium | Medium   | Medium | Medium | Long   |
| Sniper Rifle     | Large  | High     | Slow   | High   | Long   |
| Mini-Missile     | Small  | Medium   | Fast   | Low    | Medium |
| Rifle            | Medium | Medium   | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Machinegun       | Large  | Low      | Fast   | Medium | Medium |
| Grenade Launcher | Large  | Medium   | Medium | High   | Medium |
| Shotgun          | Medium | High     | Medium | High   | Short  |
| Pistol           | Small  | Medium   | Fast   | Low    | Short  |
| Rockets          | Small  | Low      | Fast   | Medium | Short  |
| Dagger           | Small  | High     | Fast   | Low    | Melee  |
| Sword            | Medium | Medium   | Medium | Medium | Melee  |
| Hammer           | Large  | Low      | Slow   | High   | Melee  |

** Pilot Skills

+ Adds bonuses to selected stats

** TODO AI Differentiation

Eventually the AIs will build their own mechs and refine their own behaviours
but for right now I'll just hard code some Stuff to get it playable.

*** DONE AIs have different mechs
*** TODO AIs have different behaviours

** DONE Tournament

+ AIs can play each other
+ You can watch AIs play each other
+ You play your matches in order

*** DONE Competitors

The concept of a "Competitor" is a Pilot + Mech, though players may customize
their mech between matches.

*** DONE Format

Hard-coded to have 1 round robin group stage of 256 in 32 groups of 8, single
winner advances, then 4 groups of 8, top two advances, then 1 round-robin
of 8. I was hoping to do double-elim but this took a WHOLE DAY so I'll drop
that.

*** DONE Implementation

**** DONE Class Tournament
Tracks tournament state 

API
+ Given a list of Combatants, generate a schedule
+ Register match played + Winner
+ Query for "Next Match Given Round"
+ View all of the above
+ Ability to save and load (?)

** UI

+ Combat log
+ Less atrocious UI
