* very bad
** exception on path not findable

I *think* this is caused when you have a NPC blocking another one from the
player/its destination, it will do a path not findable and the program will
crash

* silly
** blocking takes 0 AP

It should not do that

* UI stuff
** dead space

whoo spooky dead space spook alert

** entity scroll

you should be able to use directionals to select next, not just l/r on the
arbitrary ordering of what was added to the map when

also maybe uh skip over dead things?
