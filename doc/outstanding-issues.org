* very bad
** exception on path not findable

I *think* this is caused when you have a NPC blocking another one from the
player/its destination, it will do a path not findable and the program will
crash

** 2 AP for missed attacks in focus

I dunno what's going on here

* UI stuff
** dead space

whoo spooky dead space spook alert
