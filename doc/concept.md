# One-Sentence Summary

Scout out enemy locations, lay out your plan of attack, and then execute your
flawless plan and bring down your foes in an instant!

# Concept

You need to plan, and plan well! Your character has two modes. The first mode is
essentially a "normal" mode; you can move around, you can equip and unequip
items, you can bump attack. In this mode you're stealthy, but weak - enemies can
shoot you or rocket you and you won't have much chance to dodge them.

When you're in the second mode, "focus" mode (I need to come up with a better
name) you turn into a whirlwind of destruction. You can move multiple times a
turn, deflect bullets, dodge rockets, and cut enemies to shreds as you zoom past
them. The only catch is that you can't control your character directly in focus
mode - instead, you lay out a plan when you enter focus mode which your
character will execute.

Entering focus mode has a certain time cost, during which you'll be
vulnerable. Also, focus mode won't be so strict that you can't plan - you'll be
able to have a certain number of 'instant' moves to reposition, and you can exit
out of focus mode if you realize you've made a really bad plan.

That's the most basic explanation. The game flow will be something like:

+ Scout Area
+ Discover Enemies And Observe Traits (you'll be able to tell if an enemy has
  rockets, guns, grenades, whether they'll be liable to approach or run, etc,
  etc)
+ Plan
+ Execute plan in Focus mode
+ Possibly abort and run away to try again
+ Repeat until mission complete

# Turns and Time

Both in "normal" and "focus" mode, enemies and you will take turns in order,
with turn order being super boring and standard (you go, each one of them goes,
then you go, repeat).

However, in focus, you will have the ability to execute an increased number of
actions per turn.

This actually boils down to the concept of AP! In normal mode, everything
(moving, attacking, observing) takes one point of AP. In focus mode, you have a
bunch more AP and optional abilities that aren't available to normal mode.

Spitballing at AP costs:

## Normal Mode: 1 AP/turn

+ Move: 1
+ Observe: 1
+ Attack: 1

## Focus Mode: 4 AP/Turn

+ Move: First 2 moves free, 1 for rest
+ Deflect Bullet: First 3 free, 1/3?
+ Vault?: 2
+ Cut Head?: 2
+ Cut Limb/Torso?: 1
+ Dodge Rockets: 1

Don't know if grenades will have time to go in, but:

+ Deflect Grenades: 1
+ Throw Back Grenades: 2
